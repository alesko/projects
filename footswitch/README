IMPORTANT!

The capacitor on the shield (between RESET and GND) is used to prevet an auto reset
everytime a serial connection is established. However, it can NOT be present during reprogramming!



Communication with the Arduino board is done with the following settings.
Baudrate 9600
8 Data Bits
No Parity
One Stop Bit

The commands are formated as follows:
C#;
where C is the command character, # are the data character(s), and ; is the end of message.
Example; D2500; set the duration of a force pushing task to 2500 ms. 

N - Number of repertions of the trial. Default is 1.
A - Selects array or sensor imput to produce force. A0; set it to ?? to be implemented
D - Duration in ms, default is 3000 ms.
L - Delay beteen sensed force and produced force (not impelemened), default is 0 ms.
P - Pause between force pushing tasks duration, default is 1500.
E - Element number to set, default is 0.
F - Desiderd force, will be assigned to the current element (set element with the E command). Default is 0.
I - Number of force elemnts in the array. Maximum number is 128. Default is 24.
